The translation provided earlier is not a natural translation. To paraphrase this text accurately, we should use the more formal translation "Yes, thank you." The informal expression "Oui, oh, merci" may be an idiomatic expression used in some cultures or languages, but it\'s not a direct translation of "yes, thank you" in English.
