Target: americanus. It may grow to a length of 60 cm ( 24 in ) and a mass of 6 kilograms ( 13 lb ) , and bears a conspicuous pair of claws. In life , the lobsters are blue , only becoming " lobster red " on cooking. Mating occurs in the summer , producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into planktonic larvae. Homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food , and is widely caught using lobster pots , mostly around the British Isles.

Target: @ 2 kg ( 1 @. @ 5 – 4 @. @ 9 lb ). Like other crustaceans , lobsters have a hard exoskeleton which they must shed in order to grow , in a process called ecdysis ( moulting ). This may occur several times a year for young lobsters , but decreases to once every 1 – 2 years for larger animals.
