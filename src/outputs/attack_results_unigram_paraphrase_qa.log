Target: americanus. It may grow to a length of 60 cm ( 24 in ) and a mass of 6 kilograms ( 13 lb ) , and bears a conspicuous pair of claws. In life , the lobsters are blue , only becoming " lobster red " on cooking. Mating occurs in the summer , producing eggs which are carried by the females for up to a year before hatching into planktonic larvae. Homarus gammarus is a highly esteemed food , and is widely caught using lobster pots , mostly around the British Isles.

Generated text:  
In the given passage, it is evident that the term "type species" refers to the presence of more than one genus.
Therefore, the natural explanation for this term would be that additional organisms were identified and perhaps classified as separate genera.
With this definition, the author might create some diversity within the family structure.
The statement might be used to promote trade and direct audience/consumers towards a more formal system.
It could also be a compliment to the existing order, which could be reclassified as part of a greater order.

Target: He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 1 March 1937. Commencing in July 1938 , he was one of six students to take part in the RAAF 's first Long Specialist Navigation Course , run by Flight Lieutenants Bill Garing and Alister Murdoch at Point Cook. The course involved several epic training flights that attracted considerable media attention , including a twelve @-@ day , 10 @,@ 800 @-@ kilometre ( 6 @,@ 700 mi ) round @-@ Australia trip by three Avro Ansons , one of which was piloted by Headlam , in November. The following month , Headlam led the three Ansons on a six @-@ day journey back and forth over Central Australia. He subsequently passed the navigation course with a special distinction.

Target: The Penfui detachment attacked Japanese shipping taking part in the invasion of Celebes. Two Hudsons shot down or damaged three Japanese floatplanes that attacked them as they were bombing a transport ship on 11 January ; the next day both Hudsons were themselves shot down by Mitsubishi Zeros. Penfui was bombed by the Japanese for the first time on 26 January 1942 , and attacked regularly thereafter , damaging some aircraft. The intact Hudsons were withdrawn to Darwin but Headlam and his staff remained at Penfui to enable the base to be used by aircraft during reconnaissance missions from Australia. On 18 February , Headlam was ordered to evacuate all his personnel except a small party to demolish the airfield with assistance from Sparrow Force. He returned to Darwin the following day , just as the city experienced its first raid by the Japanese. Four of No. 2 Squadron 's Hudsons were destroyed in the attack ; the remainder were relocated to Daly Waters , where they continued to carry out reconnaissance and bombing missions against Japanese targets in Timor.

Target: His tenure as DCAS coincided with the most significant rearmament program the Air Force had undertaken since World War II , and with manpower shortages stemming from this expansion and from Australia 's increasing involvement in the security of South East Asia. The first RAAF helicopters were committed to the Vietnam War towards the end of his term , and he travelled to Saigon with the Chief of the General Staff , Lieutenant General Sir John Wilton , in March 1966 to plan the deployment. The year before , Wilton had recommended to Air Marshal Murdoch , the Chief of the Air Staff , that two Iroquois be sent to Vietnam for familiarisation purposes ; Murdoch had rebuffed Wilton , and the RAAF helicopter squadron was considered underprepared for its army co @-@ operation role when it finally did deploy. Headlam succeeded Air Vice Marshal Douglas Candy as AOC Support Command , Melbourne , on 8 August 1966.

Target: Rainfall is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year , and the wettest month of the year is March , in which an average of 6 @. @ 93 in ( 176 mm ) of rain falls. Much rainfall is delivered by thunderstorms which are common during the summer months but occur throughout the year.

These are most common during the spring months with a secondary peak during the Fall months. These storms also bring the risk of tornadoes.

The amount of precipitation depends largely on proximity to mountains, higher elevation mountains, the presence of two seas, namely the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea, and the type and intensity of airborne dust particles. The basin's broad and complex nature means that it is characterized by strong radial flow and higher velocity, resulting in a higher infrared abundance in rainwater that falls downwards. Snowfall depends mainly on how mountains are arranged. The plains receive more rainfall due to intermittent showers and early morning rains, which are mainly attributed to the basin's high humidity. The farther from the mountains, the higher the altitude and vice versa. Constant winds blowing from Iran

Target: The only home in the US south designed by noted Canadian born Architect Louis S. Curtiss , famous for inventing the glass curtain wall skyscraper , is extant on Highland Park. The Frank Fort designed <unk> Building is generally considered one of the best Art Deco skyscrapers in the US and is often compared to Detroit 's famed Fisher Building. Noted California Architect Wallace Neff designed a number of homes in Meridian as well as in the Alabama Black Belt which adjoins the city across the nearby Alabama State line. He had relatives in Meridian and Selma who were executives in the then thriving railroad industry and would take commissions in the area when commissions in California were lean. His work is mostly concentrated in the lower numbered blocks of Poplar Springs Drive where his <unk> Poplar Springs Drive is often compared to the similarly designed Falcon Lair , the Beverly Hills home in Benedict Canyon of Rudolph Valentino. One Neff work was lost to an expansion of Anderson Hospital in 1990 and another in Marion Park burned in the 1950s. The Meridian Post Office with its interior done entirely of bronze and Verde marble is also noteworthy as a very fine example of the type of Post Office structures built in thriving and well to do cities in the 1920s and originally had <unk> lighting which was removed sadly during a 1960s remodeling and which are now in private residences on Poplar Springs Drive and in North Hills.
