While both have relatively large claws and long bodies, Homarus gammarus is less commonly found in the wild, mainly in the north - western Atlantic Ocean and parts of the North Sea and the warm waters of the Mediterranean, whereas the American lobster inhabits cooler waters off the East Coast of North America. This relative difference may be attributed to the fact that the Homarus gammarus population was decimated by overfishing in the 1990s, leaving few instances of the species in the North Sea and the Black Sea. European lobsters are not typically marketed or farmed, which also contributes to their relatively'
